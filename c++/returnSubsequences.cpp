/*
Return subsequences of String
Given a string (lets say of length n), return all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n.
But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.

Note : The order of subsequences are not important.

Sample Input:

abc

Sample Output:

"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c
b
bc
a
ac
ab
abc

/* Important points :
1. There is not DP solution of it, actually we are asking to generate all possible subsets(Power Set),
    since all subsets are unique, overlapping feature doesn't exist and DP can't be used.
    So,we have to use exhaustive search.
2. subsequences,subsets are the same things. = 2^n-1 non empty subsequences
